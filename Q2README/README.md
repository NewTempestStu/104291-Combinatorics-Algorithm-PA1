# 104291-Combinatorics-Algorithm-PA1-Q2

## Introduction



## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux or any Unix-like OS.
- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) must be installed on your machine to compile the program.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Installation of GCC**: If GCC is not already installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install GCC by running `sudo apt-get install gcc` in the terminal.

2. **Downloading the Program**: Ensure that you have both the `order.c` source file and the `Makefile` in the same directory on your local machine. You can pull from github by the following url: `https://github.com/NewTempestStu/104291-Combinatorics-Algorithm-PA1`

## Compilation

This program comes with a Makefile for easy compilation. Here's how to use it:

1. **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory containing your program files.

2. **Compile the Program**: Run the command `make` in your terminal. This command instructs the make utility to compile the program according to the rules defined in the `Makefile`. It should generate an executable named `color`.
