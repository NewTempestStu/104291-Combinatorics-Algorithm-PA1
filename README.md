# 104291-Combinatorics-Algorithm-PA1-Q1

Overview
This program generates all subsets of a given set of characters, sorting them first by their size (length) and then lexicographically. It's implemented in C and is designed to run on Linux environments. The program demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation, bit manipulation, and sorting algorithms to achieve its goal.
