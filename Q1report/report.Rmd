# Detail Explaination

### Subset Generation Explanation:

The generation of subsets of an \( n \)-set is based on the concept of binary representation of numbers. Every integer can be represented as a binary number, a sequence of bits that are either 0 or 1. In the context of subsets, each bit position in the binary representation can correspond to the presence (1) or absence (0) of an element in a set. For an \( n \)-set, we can consider all binary numbers from 0 to \( 2^n - 1 \) where \( n \) is the number of elements in the set. 

For example, let's consider \( n = 3 \). The binary numbers from 0 to \( 2^3 - 1 \) (which is 7) are:

```
000 (0) - represents the empty subset {}
001 (1) - represents the subset {3}
010 (2) - represents the subset {2}
011 (3) - represents the subset {2, 3}
100 (4) - represents the subset {1}
101 (5) - represents the subset {1, 3}
110 (6) - represents the subset {1, 2}
111 (7) - represents the subset {1, 2, 3}
```

As you can see, each binary number represents a unique subset of the set \( \{1, 2, 3\} \), and this concept scales for any size of \( n \).

### Sorting Explanation:

Once all subsets are generated, the next step is to sort them. The sorting is done in two steps:

1. **By Size**: The subsets are first ordered by their size. This is straightforward: a subset with fewer elements is considered "smaller" and should come before a subset with more elements.

2. **Lexicographically**: For subsets of the same size, we order them lexicographically. This means we compare the elements of each subset as if they were words in a dictionary. We start by comparing the first element of each subset; if they are the same, we compare the second element, and so on. This step ensures that for subsets of the same size, the one with smaller elements comes first.

### Why the Algorithm Works:

The algorithm works due to the binary nature of subsets and the deterministic way of generating them using binary counting. By counting from 0 to \( 2^n - 1 \), we ensure that we explore every possible combination of elements being included or excluded, thereby generating every possible subset.

Sorting by size and then lexicographically is a common way to impose an order on a list of items. It's a natural and intuitive way to organize subsets, starting from the smallest and moving to the largest, with a consistent method for ordering subsets of the same size.

### Conclusion:

The algorithm's elegance lies in its simplicity and the way it leverages binary numbers to relate to the concept of subsets. It provides a complete and ordered enumeration of subsets, which can be a powerful tool in various fields, such as combinatorics, probability, and computer science. The sorting criteria also offer a systematic way to list subsets that is consistent with how we typically understand and handle ordered lists.
